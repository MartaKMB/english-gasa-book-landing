            Whether you’re an experienced dog owner or taking care of your first
            pup, this is a must-read to foster a friendship with your pet. I
            believe this book should be included in every breeder’s puppy pack
            and given with every adopted dog.

            A wonderful book on nonverbal ‘conversations’ with all animals. It
            addresses the essential issues of intimacy, attentiveness, and focus
            during pet massage. No matter your age or experience with manual
            techniques, this book is for you. Communication, intimacy,
            attentiveness—GaSa massage in three words.

            Unique, warm, calm, and nonintrusive. This book’s singularity and
            timelessness shows, for one, in the fact that it was ‘slow’ before
            the ‘slow life’ concept became trendy in Poland and that it followed
            the ‘you don’t have to do anything’ approach before bookstores were
            stocked with psychology books on mindfulness and letting go. The
            author was ahead of her time, which makes her the embodiment of the
            change and peace she writes about. She is consistent with the vision
            she conveys. She is GaSa, and her authenticity is so powerful that
            readers who are open to letting go will read this book not because
            they have to, but because they will want to.

            Every dog owner should read this book. For those seeking to deepen
            their conversations through subtle touch, GaSa massage can teach you
            how. You will learn techniques suitable for your dog and see how
            many benefits come from a new form of calm activity that soothes the
            emotions.
